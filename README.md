- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

To install the necessary libraries, use:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
Running the Code

    Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wildlife-image-classification.git

Prepare your dataset: Make sure you have the camera trap images dataset available. The dataset should be organized into subdirectories based on species or environmental attributes.

Start the Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook

    Load and preprocess the data: The dataset is preprocessed in the notebook, including resizing, normalization, and augmenting the images for training.

    Train the model: The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The training process is broken down into several steps, including:
        Loading the dataset
        Defining the CNN architecture
        Training the model using the dataset
        Evaluating the model's performance

    Testing and generating predictions: After training the model, you can run it on new images to predict wildlife species or environmental attributes. Use the file_to_confidence function to generate class predictions and confidence scores for an image.

AI and Computer Vision Techniques Used

    Deep Learning (AI): PyTorch was used for building and training a deep learning model that can classify images into multiple categories. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for image classification tasks.

    Computer Vision: The images from wildlife camera traps were processed using computer vision techniques to extract features necessary for classification. The model was trained to recognize different wildlife species or environmental characteristics in the images.

Wildlife and Camera Traps

This project leverages the power of AI and computer vision to analyze images captured by camera traps for wildlife monitoring. Camera traps are widely used in ecology and conservation to monitor wildlife behavior, track animal populations, and gather data for scientific research. By applying machine learning to these images, the project automates the classification process, enabling researchers to analyze large volumes of data efficiently.
Step-by-Step Guide

    Data Preparation:
        Start by loading the camera trap images into the appropriate format.
        Normalize the images and apply augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to increase the diversity of training data.

    Model Architecture:
        Define a CNN model that consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract and learn patterns from the images.
        Implement dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

    Model Training:
        Split the data into training and validation sets.
        Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
        Use the trained model to predict classes of new images.

    Generate Predictions:
        Once the model is trained, use the file_to_confidence function to classify images and generate confidence scores for the predictions.

Jupyter Notebooks

The project uses Jupyter notebooks to implement the workflow. Each step in the process is documented with both code and explanations, providing a transparent and educational guide for those looking to understand the model-building process.

The notebook includes:

    Data loading and preprocessing.
    Model definition and training.
